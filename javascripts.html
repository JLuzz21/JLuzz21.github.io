    <h1> John's Javascript Page!</h1>
    
    <p> This is my javascript website. This website was created to insert links for our javascript programs.<br>
      Javascript is a programming language that uses various programming fundamentals, and basic concepts. <br>
      Throughout the year I will be developing a better understanding of the javascript language, and learn the joy of programming.</p>
